Goal of this code: 

1. Visualize the WFS focal plane and output pupil plane 
2. Analyze the WFS gain (output slope as a function of input slope)
3. Verify wavefront reconstruction 

For several different cases:
1. Modulated pyramid wavefront sensor
   a. The star is modulated at fixed radius and uniform azimuth spacing	
   b. The star is modulated at fixed radius with random azimuth spacing
   c. The star is modulated at both random radii and azimuth spacing
