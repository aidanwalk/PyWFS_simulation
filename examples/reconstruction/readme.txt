Contains an example of how to use the reconstruction.interaction_matrix class. 

sx and sy are slopes generated using PyWFS.py, where the wavefront contains
spherical aberrations. 

to run: 
$ python reconstruction.py

This will reconstruct the wavefront and save a 3D plot to the local directory
"recovered_phase.html".
