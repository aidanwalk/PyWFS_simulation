Contains an example of how to use the reconstruction.interaction_matrix class. 
sx and sy are slopes generated using pyramidWFS.py, where the wavefront contains
X-tilt aberrations. 

to run: 
$ python reconstruction.py

This will reconstruct the wavefront and save a 3D plot to the local directory
"recovered_phase.html".
