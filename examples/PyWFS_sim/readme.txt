Contains an example of how to use the PyWFS.py to simulate a WFS measurement. 

To run:
$ python simulate_WFS.py

This will create a wavefront with spherical aberration, simulate it through the
WFS, and save the computed slopes to sx.fits and sy.fits. 

The generated wavefront slopes are saved to the local directory 
"recovered_slopes.html"
