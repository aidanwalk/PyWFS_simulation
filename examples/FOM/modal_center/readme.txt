The purpose of this script is to see how well the WFS can recover different 
Zernike aberrations, and the effect of the "negative" edges in the pyramid 
array. 

Stars fall directly in the center of the array, so for the 1x1 pyramid array, 
this is directly on the pyramid tip. 
For the 2x2 array, this is directly where 4 pyramids meet. 

It seems as though the negative edges DO produce a negative signal. This is
quite non-intuitive because the star is falling on an equal number of 
positive and negative facets in this area..
